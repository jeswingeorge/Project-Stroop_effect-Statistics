# Project-Stroop_effect-Statistics
This project was done as part of Udacity Data Analyst course.

## Background Information

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a
color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is
printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words
condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose
names match the colors in which they are printed.

In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in
which they are printed. In each case, we measure the time it
takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a
time from each condition.

In this repository, i have added the excel files in which the calculations have been done. I have also added the project report file
which contains the answers to the questions asked.
